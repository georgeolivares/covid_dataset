# COVID-19 General Analysis by Country
Hey everybody! As my first project, I decided to do an analysis on the current situation on Covid worldwide.
If you are curious of where this data came from you can find it in the following website: <https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data>

As a newcomer to this data analysis industry I asume we should have some questions or objectives before starting to upload or transform any data.
Covid is a really hot topic right now, as we all now how our lifes have changed thanks to the arrival of this 'creature'.

# Objectives for this project

I believe, according to the information in the dataset used, we can answer some of the following questions:

--> Top 5 countries with the most confirmed cases per million
--> Top 5 countries with the deaths per million
--> Are population density and confirmed cases related?
-->
