# A little bit about me.
I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Universidad de Monterrey (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico). I started as an Inbound Marketing Trainee in Mexico during University and spent almost a year in that position. I got an offer to be part of the administration team at a home appliances company, I spent almost 3 years working for this company, me and the team were responsible for the management of the ERP system within the company. We were in charge of making sure the sales, procurement and accounting team used the system properly. We created the users, teached people how to use the system, created reports for the management team and solve any issues that came with the use of this system. I really enjoyed it!
