# GeorgeOlivares_Portfolio
Hey everybody! Welcome to my humble portfolio, I will be posting all my projects in this page, feel free to give any feedback about any of the projects!
# A little bit about me.
* I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Universidad de Monterrey (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico). I started as an Inbound Marketing Trainee in Mexico during University and spent almost a year in that position. 
* I got an offer to be part of the administration team at a home appliances company, I spent almost 3 years working for this company, me and the team were responsible for the management of the ERP system within the company. We were in charge of making sure the sales, procurement and accounting team used the system properly. We created the users, teached people how to use the system, created reports for the management team and solve any issues that came with the use of this system. I really enjoyed it!
# New to Canada
* I am currently living in Vancouver, BC. I came to Vancouver in March 2021 as an international student at Greystone College for an International Business Management diploma.
* I've always consider myself a tech savy person but coding seemed like a really long shot for a regular spreadsheet lover! Nonetheless, I always wanted to at least understand how coding worked.
* Now that I've taken courses and practiced with my own databases, I've really come to like it!
* I will be posting all of my practice and real life projects in here to keep track of my improvements.
